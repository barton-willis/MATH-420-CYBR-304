# MATH-420-CYBR-304

 Here are some course Materials I used in spring 2024 for the combined class MATH 420 & CYBR 304. 
 So that the content was fresh in my mind, I created many (I'd say most) of the Julia worksheets just hours before the class. Subsequently, I've attempted to improve the worksheets, and in some cases, I got carried away and extended them beyond what we did in class.
