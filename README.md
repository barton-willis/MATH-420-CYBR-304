# MATH 420 & CYBR 304

 Here are some course Materials I used in spring 2024 for the combined class MATH 420 & CYBR 304. 

 So that the content was fresh in my mind, I created many (I'd say most) of the Julia worksheets just hours before the class. Subsequently, I've attempted to improve the worksheets, but for a few, I got carried away and extended them beyond what we did in class.

 For additional resources for teaching numerical analysis that I have created, see [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/barton-willis/Julia-notebooks-MATH-420).
